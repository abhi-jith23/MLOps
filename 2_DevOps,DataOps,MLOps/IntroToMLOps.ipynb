    "# Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "*    MLOps - Combination of DevOps-style automation methods and ML best practices focused on deployment and operations of ML models into production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    DevOps - Culture of collaboration and automation of developer operations to continuously improve deployment and reduce friction between business units. Includes automation tools and principles like CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    CI/CD - Continuous integration and continuous delivery - key practices in DevOps workflows. CI involves regular automated testing and validation of incrementally-built software while CD focuses on automatically releasing updates to environments like production.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Maturity Model - Concept in MLOps defining ascending levels, typically 4-5, of MLOps sophistication and effectiveness, from manual, siloed, unreliable to scalable, autonomous, and resilient systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Data Ops - Specific focus on use of DevOps concepts and automation principles to manage data workloads like aggregation, transformation, storage, analysis, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Feature Store - Central repository to manage, store, and serve ML features for model building and retraining. Optimizes data pipelines and reuse."
